      <p>
        When we decided on doing the Titanic for our project we looked into what we thought were the main variables of survival.
        The datasets we found were already broken up into training and testing for machine learning.
        These graphs were created using the combined data of both data sets with matplotlib and seaborn.
        A majority of the passengers boarded in South Hampton, so I filled in the two missing values as such.

      <center><h1>Embarking Location</h1></center>
      
        <center><img src="resource/images/Embarked_Survived.jpg">
      <p>
        The bar graph shows the number of passengers that survived or perished from each embarking location.
        (Survived is 1 and perished is 0)
      </p>
      <center><img src="resource/images/Embarked_Survival_PieGraph.jpg">
      <p>
        This pie graph shows the percentage of survivors from each embarking location: Cherbourg, Queenstown and South Hampton.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <center><h1>Age</h1></center>
      
        <center><img src="resource/images/Histogram_didn't_survive_age.jpg"><img src="resource/images/Histogram_survived_by_age.jpg">
      <p>
        These histograms show survival and perishing counts by age.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <center><h1>Passenger Class (Pclass)</h1></center>
      
        <center><img src="resource/images/PClass_Sutvival_Heatmap.jpg">
      <p>
        This heatmap helps determine if the higher-class passengers (Class 1) had a higher rate of survival than the lower classes (Class 2 or 3).
        It implies that passenger class contributed to a passengerâ€™s survival.
        (Survived is 1 and perished is 0)
      </p>
      <center><img src="resource/images/Sex_Survival_Graphs.jpg">
      <p>
        Survival rate of males is around 20%, whereas women is around 75%.
        Passenger gender played an important role in determining if one was going to survive (1) or perish (0).
