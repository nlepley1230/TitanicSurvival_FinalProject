For the final project of Data Science Boot Camp, our group used our new machine learning skills and applied them to a new dataset. The dataset we used was from the infamous sinking of the Titanic in 1912. We found clean testing/training data that displayed which members survived and which ones didn't. Using the data and machine learning, we looked at different models for predicting who would hypothetically survive the sinking of the Titanic. From there, we would conclude which model was more accurate at predicting. Please click each model above to visualize which one was more accurate.
